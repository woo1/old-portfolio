# Design and develop "MindTrip" which is the web framework for image deep learning and preprocessing

<!-- The Movies Project is something like **Netflix**, the only difference is that **it's not real**! It doesn't exist! I just created it to demonstrate how the **showcase** page looks like and how you can write whatever you want with full markdown support. -->

In order to support all the processes in deep learning, we designed and made this framework. Users can label image datas and managers can train models by using the labeled datas. This supports not only training and labeling but also inferencing and model management,to visualize the information.

## My Roll

1. Design and develop the whole process

## Project Result & Achievement

1. This has been used for data labeling and training in related projects in NextDoor
