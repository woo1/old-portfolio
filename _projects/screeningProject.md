# Develop pulmonary tuberculosis legion detection model for screening support

<!-- The Movies Project is something like **Netflix**, the only difference is that **it's not real**! It doesn't exist! I just created it to demonstrate how the **showcase** page looks like and how you can write whatever you want with full markdown support. -->

In order to enhance the judgment ability of the model, we made the optimal process for the model. we segment lungs from x-ray images and run detection model to find legion,to visualize the information.

## My Roll

1. Analylzing labeled data and design the process to detect legion optimally
2. Developing lung segmentation model
3. Developing pulmonary tuberculosis legion detection model

## Project Result & Achievement

1. Developed model was used for portable pulmonary tuberculosis screening project in Vietnam
